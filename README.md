# 1D Diffusion Simulation

This simulation demonstrates the 1D diffusion process of carbon in two materials, which are manufactured additively and connect to each other. The simulation uses the **Finite Element Method (FEM)** in **FEniCSx** to solve the diffusion equation over time.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/1D-diffusion-simulation.git
    ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies (FEniCSx, PETSc, MPI, etc.) using your package manager or by following the [FEniCSx installation guide](https://fenicsproject.org/download/).

3. Run the simulation:

    ```bash
    python run_simulation.py
    ```

## Results

The results of the simulation can be visualized using an animation, which shows the concentration profile and diffusion length over time.
